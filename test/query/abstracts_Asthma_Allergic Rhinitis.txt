Allergic rhinitis (AR), a common disease in otolaryngology, is a key risk factor 
for poorly controlled asthma and many complications, although it is not 
life-threatening. The negative impact of AR on social productive forces and 
human health is no less than that of asthma. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an 
important role in AR. In addition to sharing some of DC's biological 
characteristics, DCs-derived exosomes (DEXs) can promote the priming and 
activation of T cells and the maturation and differentiation of T helper type 2 
(Th2) cells. Multiple signaling pathways in AR can be modulated by DEXs, which 
present allergens and participate in allergic immune responses. Anti-allergic 
drugs can be carried by DEXs to alleviate allergic airway inflammation and treat 
Th2-mediated AR effectively. Therefore, DEXs are crucial in the pathogenesis and 
treatment of AR.

The objective of this study was to identify critical pathways associated with 
allergic constitution. Shared genes among allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma (AA), 
and atopic dermatitis (AD) were extracted from the GWAS catalog. RNA-seq data of 
AR, AA, and AD from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were preprocessed and 
subjected to differential gene expression analysis. The differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were merged using the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) algorithm. 
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify 
modules associated with allergies. Components of Guominkang (GMK) were obtained 
from 6 databases and activate components were identified by SwissADME website. 
Utilizing the SwissTarget Prediction, PharmMapper, SymMap, and HERB, the targets 
of GMK were predicted and subsequently validated using gene chip data from our 
team previous study. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) related to the 
allergic constitution were also extracted based on a previous study. Pathway 
enrichment analysis was performed using KOBAS-i on the GWAS, RRA, WGCNA modules, 
DEPs, and GMK targets. P values from multi-omics datasets were combined by 
meta-analysis, and Bonferroni correction was applied. The significant pathways 
were further validated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with 
intervention data of GMK. The GWAS results yielded 172 genes. Four datasets AR1, 
AA1, AD1, and AD2 were acquired from GSE75011, GSE125916, and GSE184237. The RRA 
algorithm identified 19 upregulated and 20 downregulated genes. WGCNA identified 
5 significant modules, with the blue and turquoise modules displaying a moderate 
correlation with allergies. By performing network pharmacology analysis, we 
identified 127 active ingredients of GMK and predicted 618 targets. Validation 
using gene chip data confirmed 107 GMK targets. Single-omics pathway analysis 
was conducted using KOBAS-i, and 39 significant pathways were identified across 
multiple omics datasets. GSEA analysis using GMK intervention data identified 11 
of 39 significant pathways as the final key pathways associated with the 
allergic constitution. Through multi-omics integrated pathway analysis, we 
identified 11 critical pathways of allergic constitution, including TH1 and TH2 
cell differentiation, TLR cascade, and TH17 cell differentiation. Identifying 
these pathways suggests that the observed alterations at the pathway level may 
play significant roles in the molecular characteristics of the allergic 
constitution.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic inflammation with fibrosis. About 
30% to 40% of patients with IgG4-RD are complicated with atopic manifestations 
as allergic rhinitis and asthma, usually with elevated serum total 
immunoglobulin E and peripheral blood eosinophils, which are also of some value 
for predicting disease activity and relapse. Similar to allergic diseases, 
activation of type 2 inflammation is also observed in the pathogenesis of 
IgG4-RD, and eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, 
IL-33, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 all participate in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD. 
Studies of susceptible genes showed that IgG4-RD and allergic disease shared the 
same susceptible genes. Monoclonal antibodies targeting type 2 inflammation 
pathway may become a novel choice for IgG4-RD treatment.

The mutational spectrum of asthma and allergy associated genes is not known 
although recent biobank based exome sequencing studies included these traits. We 
therefore conducted a secondary analysis of exome data from 281,104 UK Biobank 
samples for association of mostly rare variants with asthma, allergic rhinitis 
and atopic dermatitis. Variants of interest (VOI) were tabulated, shared genes 
annotated and compared to earlier genome-wide SNP association studies (GWAS), 
whole genome sequencing, exome and bisulfit sequencing studies. 354 VOI were 
significantly associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. 
They cluster mainly in two large regions on chromosome 6 and 17. After exclusion 
of the variants associated with atopic dermatitis and redundant variants, 321 
unique VOI remain in 122 unique genes. 30 genes are shared among the 87 genes 
with increased and the 65 genes with decreased risk for allergic disease. 85% of 
genes identified earlier by common GWAS SNPs are not replicated here. Most 
identified genes are located in interferon ɣ and IL33 signaling pathway. These 
genes include already known but also new pharmacological targets, including the 
IL33 receptor ST2/IL1RL1, as well as TLR1, ALOX15, GSDMA, BTNL2, IL13 and IKZF3. 
Future pharmacological studies will need to included these VOI for 
stratification of the study population paving the way to individualized 
treatment.

Allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, 
asthma and allergic rhinitis), perhaps more than many other traditionally 
grouped disorders, share several overlapping inflammatory pathways and risk 
factors, though we are still beginning to understand how the relevant patient 
and environmental factors uniquely shape each disease. Precision medicine is the 
concept of applying multiple levels of patient-specific data to tailor diagnoses 
and available treatments to the individual; ideally, a patient receives the 
right intervention at the right time, in order to maximize effectiveness but 
minimize morbidity, mortality and cost. While precision medicine in allergy is 
in its infancy, the recent success of biologics, development of tools focused on 
large data set integration and improved sampling methods are encouraging and 
demonstrates the utility of refining our understanding of allergic endotypes to 
improve therapies. Some of the biggest challenges to achieving precision 
medicine in allergy are characterizing allergic endotypes, understanding 
allergic multimorbidity relationships, contextualizing the impact of 
environmental exposures (the "exposome") and ancestry/genetic risks, achieving 
actionable multi-omics integration, and using this information to develop 
adequately powered patient cohorts and refined clinical trials. In this paper, 
we highlight several recently developed tools and methods showing promise to 
realize the aspirational potential of precision medicine in allergic disease. We 
also outline current challenges, including exposome sampling and building the 
"knowledge network" with multi-omics integration.

Biologic agents, monoclonal antibodies that target highly-specific molecular 
pathways of inflammation, are becoming integrated into care pathways for 
multiple disorders that are relevant in otolaryngology and allergy. These 
conditions share common inflammatory mechanisms of so-called Type 2 inflammation 
with dysregulation of immunoglobulin E production and eosinophil and mast cell 
degranulation leading to tissue damage. Biologic agents are now available for 
the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, 
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), atopic dermatitis (AD), 
and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). This paper summarizes the diagnosis and 
management of these conditions and critically reviews the clinical trial data 
that has led to regulatory approval of biologic agents for these conditions.

: Osteoporosis and allergic diseases are important causes of morbidity, and 
traditionally their coexistence has been attributed to causality, to independent 
processes, and they were considered unrelated. However, the increasing knowledge 
in the field of osteoimmunology and an increasing number of epidemiological and 
biological studies have provided support to a correlation between bone and 
allergy that share pathways, cells, cytokines and mediators. If the link between 
allergic pathology and bone alterations appears more subtle, there are 
conditions such as mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic or hyper-IgE syndromes 
characterized by the proliferation of cells or hyper-production of molecules 
that play a key role in allergies, in which this link is at least clinically 
more evident, and the diseases are accompanied by frank skeletal involvement, 
offering multiple speculation cues. The pathophysiological connection of allergy 
and osteoporosis is currently an intriguing area of research. The aim of this 
review is to summarize and bring together the current knowledge and pursue an 
opportunity to stimulate further investigation.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms explaining multimorbidity between asthma, dermatitis 
and rhinitis (allergic multimorbidity) are not well known. We investigated these 
mechanisms and their specificity in distinct cell types by means of an 
interactome-based analysis of expression data.
METHODS: Genes associated to the diseases were identified using data mining 
approaches, and their multimorbidity mechanisms in distinct cell types were 
characterized by means of an in silico analysis of the topology of the human 
interactome.
RESULTS: We characterized specific pathomechanisms for multimorbidities between 
asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis for distinct emergent non-eosinophilic cell 
types. We observed differential roles for cytokine signaling, TLR-mediated 
signaling and metabolic pathways for multimorbidities across distinct cell 
types. Furthermore, we also identified individual genes potentially associated 
to multimorbidity mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the existence of differentiated multimorbidity 
mechanisms between asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis at cell type level, as well 
as mechanisms common to distinct cell types. These results will help 
understanding the biology underlying allergic multimorbidity, assisting in the 
design of new clinical studies.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause several upper airway symptoms 
and alter the physiology of nasopharyngeal mucosa, while upper airway diseases 
in turn might also exacerbate GERD symptoms. For a long time, asthma was 
considered a risk factor of GERD in the literature. Asthma and allergic rhinitis 
(AR) are usually identified as united airway disease according to similar 
epidemiology and pathophysiology; however, the association between AR and GERD 
is less elucidated. We aimed to evaluate whether AR would increase the 
development of GERD. Patients diagnosed as AR were identified from the National 
Health Insurance Research Database between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 
without prior history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The outcome of 
interest was new-onset GERD. Cox regression models were applied to calculate the 
hazard ratio (HR) of GERD. We analyzed the data of 193,810 AR patients aged 18 
years or older and being free of AR at baseline. The AR cohort (n = 96,905) had 
a significantly increased risk of GERD over a non-AR cohort (n = 96905) 
(adjusted HR (aHR) 1.94; 95% CI = 1.88-1.99, p < 0.001). AR may have stronger 
correlation with GERD than does asthma, although asthma might increase GERD risk 
by means of certain pathways shared with AR.

Allergic asthma often coexists with different pathological conditions, called 
multimorbidities, that are mostly of allergic nature and share a common 
underlying inflammatory pathophysiological mechanism. Multimorbidities of 
allergic asthma may influence asthma control, its severity, and patients' 
response to treatment, and contribute to the overall socioeconomic burden of the 
disease. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is known to play a central role in the 
pathogenesis of various allergic diseases, including asthma. Thus, IgE-mediated 
immunologic pathways present an attractive target for intervention in asthma and 
multimorbidities. In this review, we discuss the most frequently reported 
IgE-mediated multimorbidities in allergic asthma, including allergic rhinitis, 
rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, food allergies, and allergic bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against 
IgE and has been in use to treat allergic asthma for more than a decade. We 
comprehensively review the clinical evidence for omalizumab in the treatment of 
the aforementioned multimorbidities in allergic asthma.
