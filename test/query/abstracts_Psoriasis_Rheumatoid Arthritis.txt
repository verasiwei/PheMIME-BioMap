INTRODUCTION: For some immune-mediated disorders, despite the range of therapies 
available there is limited evidence on which treatment sequences are best for 
patients and healthcare systems. We investigated how their selection can impact 
outcomes in an Italian setting.
METHODS: A 3-year state-transition treatment-sequencing model calculated 
potential effectiveness improvements and budget reallocation considerations 
associated with implementing optimal sequences in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 
Crohn's disease (CD), non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (NR-AxSpA), 
plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
and ulcerative colitis (UC). Sequences included three biological or 
disease-modifying treatments, followed by best supportive care. Disease-specific 
response measures were selected on the basis of clinical relevance, data 
availability, and data quality. Efficacy was differentiated between 
biologic-naïve and experienced populations, where possible, using published 
network meta-analyses and real-world data. All possible treatment sequences, 
based on reimbursement as of December 2022 in Italy (analyses' base country), 
were simulated.
RESULTS: Sequences with the best outcomes consistently employed the most 
efficacious therapies earlier in the treatment pathway. Improvements to 
prescribing practice are possible in all diseases; however, most notable was UC, 
where the per-patient 3-year average treatment failure was 37.3% higher than 
optimal. The results focused on the three most crowded and prevalent 
immunological sub-condition diseases in dermatology, rheumatology, and 
gastroenterology: PsO, RA, and UC, respectively. By prescribing from within the 
top 20% of the most efficacious sequences, the model found a 15.1% reduction in 
treatment failures, with a 1.59% increase in drug costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing more efficacious treatments earlier provides a greater 
opportunity to improve patient outcomes and minimizes treatment failures.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory arthritis (IAs), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), are characterized by the presence of chronic 
synovitis. The Krenn's synovitis score (KSS), a simple tool detectable by 
haematoxylin/eosin staining of synovial biopsy samples, allows the 
discrimination between high-grade and low-grade synovitis. The aim of this study 
was to identify the clinical associations of KSS and to evaluate the 
relationship between high-grade synovitis and treatment response in IA patients.
METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and ultrasound data were retrieved from RA and PsA 
patients recruited in the prospective MATRIX cohort study. Inclusion criteria 
were age≥18 years, RA or PsA diagnosis, and presence of active disease with 
eligibility to start/modify therapy. Patients underwent ultrasound-guided 
synovial biopsy of one of the most involved joints before starting/modifying 
treatment according to treat-to-target strategy. The samples were analysed by an 
expert pathologist for KSS calculation. Univariable and multivariable logistic 
regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between KSS and 
baseline variables. The association between KSS and treatment response at 24 
weeks of follow-up was investigated in univariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: 53 patients, 34 RA and 19 PsA, completed 24 weeks of follow-up after 
synovial biopsy. Patients were either treatment naïve (N=6, 11%), 
csDMARDs-experienced (N=46, 87%) or b/tsDMARDs-experienced (N=20, 38%). Median 
KSS was 6.00 (Q1-Q3 4.00-7.00) in RA and 4.00 (3.00-6.00) in PsA (p=0.040), and 
inflammatory infiltrates score was significantly higher in RA than in PsA 
patients (median 3.00 vs 2.00, p=0.021). In multivariable analysis, synovial 
effusion in the biopsied joint (OR 9.26, 95%CI 2.12-53.91) and erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) (OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.08) associated with high KSS. 
High-grade synovitis significantly associated with a higher probability of 
achieving DAS28 remission, ACR20/50 response, and Boolean2.0 remission, 
independently from diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Several markers of pro-inflammatory pathways associated with the 
presence of high-grade synovitis, and patients with higher KSS shared a higher 
probability of treatment targets achievement in the follow up. The integration 
of a simple and feasible tool like KSS in the clinical and prognostic 
stratification of patients with IA might help in intercepting patients with a 
disease more prone to respond to available treatment paradigms.

Fundamental insight gained over the last decades led to the discovery of 
cytokines as pivotal drivers of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis/psoriasis arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, atopic 
dermatitis and spondylarthritis. A deeper understanding of the pro-inflammatory 
and anti-inflammatory effects of various cytokines has prompted new 
cytokine-targeting therapies, which revolutionised the treatment options in the 
last years for patients with inflammatory disorders. Disease-associated immune 
responses typically involve a complex interplay of multiple cytokines. 
Therefore, blockade of one single cytokine does not necessarily lead to a 
persistent remission in all patients with inflammatory disorders and fostered 
new therapeutic strategies targeting intracellular pathways shared by multiple 
cytokines. By inhibiting JAK-STAT signalling pathways common to families of 
cytokines, JAK-inhibitors (JAKinibs) have created a new paradigm for the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases. Multiple agents have been approved for 
various disorders and more are being investigated for several new indications. 
Second-generation selective JAKinibs have been devised with the aim to achieve 
an increased selectivity and a possible reduced risk of side effects. In the 
current review, we will summarise the current body of evidence of pan versus 
selective JAKinibs and the most recent insights on new side effects and 
indications, including COVID-19.

The term "immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs)" refers to several 
inflammatory pathologies of multifactorial etiology and involving either 
simultaneously or sequentially more organs. IMIDs share some common pathogenic 
mechanisms, which account for some similarities in the clinical course and the 
impact that these diseases may have on other organs and systems of the body. 
However, there are some differences in the IMID-associated pathological process, 
including the synthesis and function of multiple inflammatory cytokines, which 
are supposed to perpetuate the tissue-damaging inflammation. This justifies the 
different indications and responsiveness to corticosteroids, immunosuppressors, 
small molecules, and biologics. Many individuals with IMIDs are, however, 
intolerant, or unresponsive to the current drugs, thus suggesting the necessity 
of novel therapeutic approaches, such as the combination of compounds that 
either inhibit more immuno-inflammatory networks selectively or simultaneously 
suppress inflammatory signals and activate counter-regulatory pathways. In this 
article, we highlight the most relevant features of IMIDs and discuss how 
clinicians can combat the detrimental immune response in such disorders.

Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases (ICD-10: J30-J39), such 
as diseases of the sinonasal tract, pharynx and larynx, are growing health 
problems yet their genomic similarity is not known. We analyze genome-wide 
association to eight upper respiratory diseases (61,195 cases) among 260,405 
FinnGen participants, meta-analyzing diseases in four groups based on an 
underlying genetic correlation structure. Aiming to understand which genetic 
loci contribute to susceptibility to upper respiratory diseases in general and 
its subtypes, we detect 41 independent genome-wide significant loci, 
distinguishing impact on sinonasal or pharyngeal diseases, or both. Fine-mapping 
implicated non-synonymous variants in nine genes, including three linked to 
immune-related diseases. Phenome-wide analysis implicated asthma and atopic 
dermatitis at sinonasal disease loci, and inflammatory bowel diseases and other 
immune-mediated disorders at pharyngeal disease loci. Upper respiratory diseases 
also genetically correlated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and psoriasis. Finally, we associated 
separate gene pathways in sinonasal and pharyngeal diseases that both contribute 
to type 2 immunological reaction. We show shared heritability among upper 
respiratory diseases that extends to several immune-mediated diseases with 
diverse mechanisms, such as type 2 high inflammation.

Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and lupus 
erythematosus are some of common inflammatory diseases. These affections are 
highly disabling and share signals such as inflammatory sequences and immune 
dysregulation. The use of foods with anti-inflammatory properties such as ginger 
(Zingiber officinale Roscoe) could improve the quality of life of these 
patients. Ginger is a plant widely used and known by its bioactive compounds. 
There is enough evidence to prove that ginger possesses multiple biological 
activities, especially antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge about the bioactive compounds of 
ginger and their role in the inflammatory process and its signaling pathways. We 
can conclude that the compounds 6-shoagol, zingerone, and 8-shoagol display 
promising results in human and animal models, reducing some of the main symptoms 
of some inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. For lupus, 6-gingerol 
demonstrated a protective attenuating neutrophil extracellular trap release in 
response to phosphodiesterase inhibition. Ginger decreases NF-kβ in psoriasis, 
and its short-term administration may be an alternative coadjuvant treatment. 
Ginger may exert a function of supplementation and protection against cancer. 
Furthermore, when receiving chemotherapy, ginger may reduce some symptoms of 
treatment (e.g., nausea).

OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune and allergic diseases are outcomes of the dysregulation 
of the immune system. Our study aimed to elucidate differences or shared 
components in genetic backgrounds between autoimmune and allergic diseases.
METHODS: We estimated genetic correlation and performed multi-trait and 
cross-population genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of six 
immune-related diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes 
for autoimmune diseases and asthma, atopic dermatitis and pollinosis for 
allergic diseases. By integrating large-scale biobank resources (Biobank Japan 
and UK biobank), our study included 105 721 cases and 433 663 controls. Newly 
identified variants were evaluated in 21 778 cases and 712 767 controls for two 
additional autoimmune diseases: psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We 
performed enrichment analyses of cell types and biological pathways to highlight 
shared and distinct perspectives.
RESULTS: Autoimmune and allergic diseases were not only mutually classified 
based on genetic backgrounds but also they had multiple positive genetic 
correlations beyond the classifications. Multi-trait GWAS meta-analysis newly 
identified six allergic disease-associated loci. We identified four loci shared 
between the six autoimmune and allergic diseases (rs10803431 at PRDM2, OR=1.07, 
p=2.3×10-8, rs2053062 at G3BP1, OR=0.90, p=2.9×10-8, rs2210366 at HBS1L, 
OR=1.07, p=2.5×10-8 in Japanese and rs4529910 at POU2AF1, OR=0.96, p=1.9×10-10 
across ancestries). Associations of rs10803431 and rs4529910 were confirmed at 
the two additional autoimmune diseases. Enrichment analysis demonstrated link to 
T cells, natural killer cells and various cytokine signals, including innate 
immune pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our multi-trait and cross-population study should elucidate complex 
pathogenesis shared components across autoimmune and allergic diseases.

While anti-TNFα has been established as an effective therapeutic approach for 
several autoimmune diseases, results from clinical trials have uncovered 
heterogeneous patients' response to therapy. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis 
on the publicly available gene expression cDNA microarray datasets that examine 
the differential expression observed in response to anti-TNFα therapy with 
psoriasis (PsO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Five disease-specific meta-analyses and a single combined random-effects 
meta-analysis were performed through the restricted maximum likelihood method. 
Gene Ontology and Reactome Pathways enrichment analyses were conducted, while 
interactions between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined with 
the STRING database. Four IBD, three PsO and two RA datasets were identified and 
included in our analyses through our search criteria. Disease-specific 
meta-analyses detected distinct pro-inflammatory down-regulated DEGs for each 
disease, while pathway analyses identified common inflammatory patterns involved 
in the pathogenesis of each disease. Combined meta-analyses further revealed 
DEGs that participate in anti-inflammatory pathways, namely IL-10 signaling. Our 
analyses provide the framework for a transcriptomic approach in response to 
anti-TNFα therapy in the above diseases. Elucidation of the complex interactions 
involved in such multifactorial phenotypes could identify key molecular targets 
implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, PsO and RA.

We performed a database mining on 102 transcriptomic datasets for the 
expressions of 29 m6A-RNA methylation (epitranscriptomic) regulators (m6A-RMRs) 
in 41 diseases and cancers and made significant findings: (1) a few m6A-RMRs 
were upregulated; and most m6A-RMRs were downregulated in sepsis, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and trauma; (2) half of 29 m6A-RMRs were 
downregulated in atherosclerosis; (3) inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid 
arthritis modulated m6A-RMRs more than lupus and psoriasis; (4) some organ 
failures shared eight upregulated m6A-RMRs; end-stage renal failure (ESRF) 
downregulated 85% of m6A-RMRs; (5) Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
infections modulated m6A-RMRs the most among viral infections; (6) 
proinflammatory oxPAPC modulated m6A-RMRs more than DAMP stimulation including 
LPS and oxLDL; (7) upregulated m6A-RMRs were more than downregulated m6A-RMRs in 
cancer types; five types of cancers upregulated ≥10 m6A-RMRs; (8) 
proinflammatory M1 macrophages upregulated seven m6A-RMRs; (9) 86% of m6A-RMRs 
were differentially expressed in the six clusters of CD4+Foxp3+ 
immunosuppressive Treg, and 8 out of 12 Treg signatures regulated m6A-RMRs; (10) 
immune checkpoint receptors TIM3, TIGIT, PD-L2, and CTLA4 modulated m6A-RMRs, 
and inhibition of CD40 upregulated m6A-RMRs; (11) cytokines and interferons 
modulated m6A-RMRs; (12) NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways upregulated more than 
downregulated m6A-RMRs whereas TP53, PTEN, and APC did the opposite; (13) 
methionine-homocysteine-methyl cycle enzyme Mthfd1 downregulated more than 
upregulated m6A-RMRs; (14) m6A writer RBM15 and one m6A eraser FTO, H3K4 
methyltransferase MLL1, and DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, regulated m6A-RMRs; 
and (15) 40 out of 165 ROS regulators were modulated by m6A eraser FTO and two 
m6A writers METTL3 and WTAP. Our findings shed new light on the functions of 
upregulated m6A-RMRs in 41 diseases and cancers, nine cellular and molecular 
mechanisms, novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory disorders, metabolic 
cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, organ failures, and cancers.

Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine composed of two subunits, 
IL-23A (p19) and IL-12/23B (p40), the latter shared with Interleukin-12 (IL-12). 
IL-23 is mainly produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to 
exogenous or endogenous signals, and drives the differentiation and activation 
of T helper 17 (Th17) cells with subsequent production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, 
IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Although IL-23 plays a pivotal role 
in the protective immune response to bacterial and fungal infections, its 
dysregulation has been shown to exacerbate chronic immune-mediated inflammation. 
Well-established experimental data support the concept that IL-23/IL-17 axis 
activation contributes to the development of several inflammatory diseases, such 
as PsA, Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis; AS, Ankylosing Spondylitis; IBD, 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease; RA, Rheumatoid Arthritis; SS, Sjogren Syndrome; MS, 
Multiple Sclerosis. As a result, emerging clinical studies have focused on the 
blockade of this pathogenic axis as a promising therapeutic target in several 
autoimmune disorders; nevertheless, a greater understanding of its contribution 
still requires further investigation. This review aims to elucidate the most 
recent studies and literature data on the pathogenetic role of IL-23 and Th17 
cells in inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
