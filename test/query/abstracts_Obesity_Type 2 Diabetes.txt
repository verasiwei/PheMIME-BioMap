Malic Enzyme 1 (ME1) plays an integral role in fatty acid synthesis and cellular 
energetics through its production of NADPH and pyruvate. As such, it has been 
identified as a gene of interest in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and an array of 
epithelial cancers, with most work being performed in vitro. The current 
standard model for ME1 loss in vivo is the spontaneous Mod-1 null allele, which 
produces a canonically inactive form of ME1. Herein, we describe two new 
genetically engineered mouse models exhibiting ME1 loss at dynamic timepoints. 
Using murine embryonic stem cells and Flp/FRT and Cre/loxP class switch 
recombination, we established a germline Me1 knockout model (Me1 KO) and an 
inducible conditional knockout model (Me1 cKO), activated upon tamoxifen 
treatment in adulthood. Collectively, neither the Me1 KO nor Me1 cKO models 
exhibited deleterious phenotype under standard laboratory conditions. Knockout 
of ME1 was validated by immunohistochemistry and genotype confirmed by PCR. 
Transmission patterns favor Me1 loss in Me1 KO mice when maternally transmitted 
to male progeny. Hematological examination of these models through complete 
blood count and serum chemistry panels revealed no discrepancy with their 
wild-type counterparts. Orthotopic pancreatic tumors in Me1 cKO mice grow 
similarly to Me1 expressing mice. Similarly, no behavioral phenotype was 
observed in Me1 cKO mice when aged for 52 weeks. Histological analysis of 
several tissues revealed no pathological phenotype. These models provide a more 
modern approach to ME1 knockout in vivo while opening the door for further study 
into the role of ME1 loss under more biologically relevant, stressful 
conditions.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter, type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are emerging as the 
gold standard for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with renal protective 
benefits independent of glucose lowering. We took a high-level approach to 
evaluate the effects of the SGLT2i, empagliflozin (EMPA) on renal metabolism and 
function in a prediabetic model of metabolic syndrome. Male and female 12-wk-old 
TallyHo (TH) mice, and their closest genetic lean strain (Swiss-Webster, SW) 
were treated with a high-milk-fat diet (HMFD) plus/minus EMPA (@0.01%) for 
12-wk. Kidney weights and glomerular filtration rate were slightly increased by 
EMPA in the TH mice. Glomerular feature analysis by unsupervised clustering 
revealed sexually dimorphic clustering, and one unique cluster relating to EMPA. 
Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive areas, reflecting basement membranes and 
mesangium were slightly reduced by EMPA. Phasor-fluorescent life-time imaging 
(FLIM) of free-to-protein bound NADH in cortex showed a marginally greater 
reliance on oxidative phosphorylation with EMPA. Overall, net urine sodium, 
glucose, and albumin were slightly increased by EMPA. In TH, EMPA reduced the 
sodium phosphate cotransporter, type 2 (NaPi-2), but increased sodium hydrogen 
exchanger, type 3 (NHE3). These changes were absent or blunted in SW. EMPA led 
to changes in urine exosomal microRNA profile including, in females, enhanced 
levels of miRs 27a-3p, 190a-5p, and 196b-5p. Network analysis revealed "cancer 
pathways" and "FOXO signaling" as the major regulated pathways. Overall, EMPA 
treatment to prediabetic mice with limited renal disease resulted in 
modifications in renal metabolism, structure, and transport, which may preclude 
and underlie protection against kidney disease with developing T2D.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Renal protection afforded by sodium glucose transporter, type 2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i), e.g., empagliflozin (EMPA) involves complex intertwined 
mechanisms. Using a novel mouse model of obesity with insulin resistance, the 
TallyHo/Jng (TH) mouse on a high-milk-fat diet (HMFD), we found subtle changes 
in metabolism including altered regulation of sodium transporters that line the 
renal tubule. New potential epigenetic determinants of metabolic changes 
relating to FOXO and cancer signaling pathways were elucidated from an altered 
urine exosomal microRNA signature.

The co-occurrence of insulin resistance (IR)-related metabolic conditions with 
neuropsychiatric disorders is a complex public health challenge. Evidence of the 
genetic links between these phenotypes is emerging, but little is currently 
known about the genomic regions and biological functions that are involved. To 
address this, we performed Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA) 
using large-scale (N=9,725-933,970) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
results for three IR-related conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and 
metabolic syndrome) and nine neuropsychiatric disorders. Subsequently, 
positional and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based gene mapping and 
downstream functional genomic analyses were performed on the significant loci. 
Patterns of negative and positive local genetic correlations (|rg|=0.21-1, 
pFDR<0.05) were identified at 109 unique genomic regions across all phenotype 
pairs. Local correlations emerged even in the absence of global genetic 
correlations between IR-related conditions and Alzheimer's disease, bipolar 
disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Genes mapped to the correlated regions showed 
enrichment in biological pathways integral to immune-inflammatory function, 
vesicle trafficking, insulin signalling, oxygen transport, and lipid metabolism. 
Colocalisation analyses further prioritised 10 genetically correlated regions 
for likely harbouring shared causal variants, displaying high deleterious or 
regulatory potential. These variants were found within or in close proximity to 
genes, such as SLC39A8 and HLA-DRB1, that can be targeted by supplements and 
already known drugs, including omega-3/6 fatty acids, immunomodulatory, 
antihypertensive, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Overall, our findings 
underscore the complex genetic landscape of IR-neuropsychiatric multimorbidity, 
advocating for an integrated disease model and offering novel insights for 
research and treatment strategies in this domain.

Previous studies have revealed that membrane phospholipid composition controlled 
by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) is involved in the 
development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting Lpcat3 in the treatment of 
insulin resistance in diabetic mouse models. Lpcat3 expression was suppressed in 
the whole body by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) injection or in the liver by 
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-encoded Cre in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and 
genetic ob/ob type 2 diabetic mouse models. Glucose tolerance test (GTT), 
insulin tolerance test (ITT), fasting blood glucose, and insulin levels were 
used to assess insulin sensitivity. Lipid levels in the liver and serum were 
measured. The expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis was analyzed 
by real-time RT-PCR. Metabolic rates were measured by indirect calorimetry using 
the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). Our data demonstrate 
that acute knockout of hepatic Lpcat3 by AAV-Cre improves both hyperglycemia and 
hypertriglyceridemia in HFD-fed mice. Similarly, whole-body ablation of Lpcat3 
by ASO administration improves obesity and insulin resistance in both HFD-fed 
and ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that targeting LPCAT3 could be a 
novel therapy for insulin resistance.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity have a higher risk of 
developing Alzheimer disease (AD), and increasing evidence indicates a link 
between impaired immune signaling pathways and the development of AD. However, 
the shared cellular mechanisms and molecular signatures among these 3 diseases 
remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to uncover similar molecular 
markers and pathways involved in obesity, T2D, and AD using bioinformatics and a 
network biology approach. First, we investigated the 3 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
gene expression data sets and determined 224 commonly shared differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) from obesity, T2D, and AD diseases. Gene ontology and 
pathway enrichment analyses revealed that mutual DEGs were mainly enriched with 
immune and inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, we constructed a 
protein-protein interactions network for finding hub genes, which have not 
previously been identified as playing a critical role in these 3 diseases. 
Furthermore, the transcriptional factors and protein kinases regulating commonly 
shared DEGs among obesity, T2D, and AD were also identified. Finally, we 
suggested potential drug candidates as possible therapeutic interventions for 3 
diseases. The results of this bioinformatics analysis provided a new 
understanding of the potential links between obesity, T2D, and AD pathologies.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most widespread chronic liver 
disease worldwide, confers a significant burden on health systems and leads to 
increased mortality and morbidity through several extrahepatic complications. 
NAFLD comprises a broad spectrum of liver-related disorders, including 
steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It affects almost 30% of 
adults in the general population and up to 70% of people with type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM), sharing common pathogenetic pathways with the latter. In addition, NAFLD 
is closely related to obesity, which acts in synergy with other predisposing 
conditions, including alcohol consumption, provoking progressive and insidious 
liver damage. Among the most potent risk factors for accelerating the 
progression of NAFLD to fibrosis or cirrhosis, diabetes stands out. Despite the 
rapid rise in NAFLD rates, identifying the optimal treatment remains a 
challenge. Interestingly, NAFLD amelioration or remission appears to be 
associated with a lower risk of T2DM, indicating that liver-centric therapies 
could reduce the risk of developing T2DM and vice versa. Consequently, assessing 
NAFLD requires a multidisciplinary approach to identify and manage this 
multisystemic clinical entity early. With the continuously emerging new 
evidence, innovative therapeutic strategies are being developed for the 
treatment of NAFLD, prioritizing a combination of lifestyle changes and 
glucose-lowering medications. Based on recent evidence, this review scrutinizes 
all practical and sustainable interventions to achieve a resolution of NAFLD 
through a multimodal approach.

Patients with psoriasis often complain of several linked disorders including 
autoimmune and cardiometabolic diseases. Understanding of molecular link between 
psoriasis and associated comorbidities would be of great interest at the point 
of patient care management. Integrative unbiased network approach, indicates 
significant unidirectional gene overlap between psoriasis and its associated 
comorbid condition including obesity (31 upregulated and 26 downregulated), 
ischemic stroke (14 upregulated and 2 downregulated), dyslipidaemia (5 
upregulated, 5 downregulated), atherosclerosis (8 upregulated and 1 
downregulated) and type II diabetes (5 upregulated, 5 downregulated). The 
analysis revealed substantial gene sharing among the different 
psoriasis-associated comorbidities. Molecular comorbidity index determining the 
strength of the interrelation between psoriasis and its comorbidities indicates 
prevalence of dyslipidaemia followed by type II diabetes among psoriasis 
patients. The Jaccard coefficient indices revealed psoriasis shared maximum 
number of biological pathways with dyslipidaemia followed by type 2 diabetes, 
ischemic stroke, obesity and atherosclerosis. Moreover, pathway annotation 
highlighted nearly 45 shared pathways amongst psoriasis and its comorbidities 
and a substantial number of shared pathways was found among multi-morbidities. 
Overall, the present study established conceivable link between psoriasis and 
comorbid diseases. The shared genes and overlapped pathways may be explored as a 
common productive target for psoriasis and its comorbid conditions.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse 
pathophysiological processes. To characterise the genetic contribution to these 
processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% non-European ancestry), including 
428,452 T2D cases. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at 
genome-wide significance (P<5×10-8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are 
previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals 
characterised by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These 
clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type specific regions of open 
chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial, and 
enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned genetic risk scores 
(GRS) in an additional 137,559 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 10,159 
T2D cases, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. 
Cluster-specific partitioned GRS are more strongly associated with coronary 
artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy than an overall T2D GRS across 
ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the 
development of vascular outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the value of 
integrating multi-ancestry GWAS with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the 
aetiological heterogeneity driving the development and progression of T2D, which 
may offer a route to optimise global access to genetically-informed diabetes 
care.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD) represent major health 
issues that have reached alarming levels in the last decades. Although growing 
evidence demonstrates that AD is a significant comorbidity of T2D, and there is 
a ~1.4-2-fold increase in the risk of developing AD among T2D patients, the 
involvement of possible common triggers in the pathogenesis of these two 
diseases remains largely unknown. Of note, recent mechanistic insights suggest 
that lipotoxicity could represent the missing ring in the pathogenetic 
mechanisms linking T2D to AD. Indeed, obesity, which represents the main cause 
of lipotoxicity, has been recognized as a major risk factor for both 
pathological conditions. Lipotoxicity can lead to inflammation, insulin 
resistance, oxidative stress, ceramide and amyloid accumulation, endoplasmic 
reticulum stress, ferroptosis, and autophagy, which are shared biological events 
in the pathogenesis of T2D and AD. In the current review, we try to provide a 
critical and comprehensive view of the common molecular pathways activated by 
lipotoxicity in T2D and AD, attempting to summarize how these mechanisms can 
drive future research and open the way to new therapeutic perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition of 
hyperandrogenism, chronic ovulation, and polycystic ovaries in females during 
the reproduction and maturation of the ovum. Although PCOS has been associated 
with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity (OBE), and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), Causal connection and molecular features are still 
unknown.
PURPOSE: Therefore, we investigated the shared common differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs), pathways, and networks of associated proteins in PCOS and 
metabolic diseases with therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: We have used a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze transcriptome data 
for the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity 
(OBE), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in female patients. Then we employed 
gene-disease association network, gene ontology (GO) and signaling pathway 
analysis, selection of hub genes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, 
molecular docking, and gold benchmarking approach to screen potential hub 
proteins.
RESULT: We discovered 2225 DEGs in PCOS patients relative to healthy controls 
and 34, 91, and 205 significant DEGs with T2D, Obesity, and CVD, respectively. 
Gene Ontology analysis revealed several significant shared and metabolic 
pathways from signaling pathway analysis. Furthermore, we identified ten 
potential hub proteins from PPI analysis that may serve as a therapeutic 
intervention in the future. Finally, we targeted one significant hub protein, 
IGF2R (PDB ID: 2V5O), out of ten hub proteins based on the Maximal clique 
centrality (MCC) algorithm and literature review for molecular docking study. 
Enzastaurin (-12.5), Kaempferol (-9.1), Quercetin (-9.0), and Coumestrol (-8.9) 
kcal/mol showed higher binding affinity in the molecular docking approach than 
19 drug compounds. We have also found that the selected four compounds displayed 
favorable ADMET properties compared to the native ligand.
CONCLUSION: Our in-silico research findings identified a shared molecular 
etiology between PCOS and metabolic diseases that may suggest new therapeutic 
targets and warrants future experimental validation of the key targets.
