Craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors of the central nervous system that typically 
present with symptoms such as headache and visual impairment, and those 
reflecting endocrine abnormalities, which seriously affect the quality of life 
of patients. Patients with craniopharyngiomas are at higher cardiometabolic 
risk, defined as conditions favoring the development of type 2 diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying common pathogenic mechanisms of 
craniopharyngiomas and type 2 diabetes are not clear. Especially due to the 
difficulty of conducting in vitro or in vivo experiments on craniopharyngioma, 
we thought the common pathway analysis between craniopharyngioma and type 2 
diabetes based on bioinformatics is a powerful and feasible method. In the 
present study, using public datasets (GSE94349, GSE68015, GSE38642 and GSE41762) 
obtained from the GEO database, the gene expression associated with 
adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, a subtype of craniopharyngioma, and type 2 
diabetes were analyzed using a bioinformatic approach. We found 11 hub genes 
using a protein-protein interaction network analysis. Of these, seven (DKK1, 
MMP12, KRT14, PLAU, WNT5B, IKBKB, and FGF19) were also identified by least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. Finally, single-gene 
validation and receptor operating characteristic analysis revealed that four of 
these genes (MMP12, PLAU, KRT14, and DKK1) may be involved in the common 
pathogenetic mechanism of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma and type 2 
diabetes. In addition, we have characterized the differences in immune cell 
infiltration that characterize these two diseases, providing a reference for 
further research.

Studies suggest links between diabetes and gastrointestinal (GI) traits; 
however, their underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we 
comprehensively assess the genetic relationship between type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
and GI disorders. Our study demonstrates a significant positive global genetic 
correlation of T2D with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS), gastritis-duodenitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and 
diverticular disease, but not inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We identify 
several positive local genetic correlations (negative for T2D - IBD) 
contributing to T2D's relationship with GI disorders. Univariable and 
multivariable Mendelian randomisation analyses suggest causal effects of T2D on 
PUD and gastritis-duodenitis and bidirectionally with GERD. Gene-based analyses 
reveal a gene-level genetic overlap between T2D and GI disorders and identify 
several shared genes reaching genome-wide significance. Pathway-based study 
implicates leptin (T2D - IBD), thyroid, interferon, and notch signalling (T2D - 
IBS), abnormal circulating calcium (T2D - PUD), cardiovascular, viral, 
proinflammatory and (auto)immune-mediated mechanisms in T2D and GI disorders. 
These findings support a risk-increasing genetic overlap between T2D and GI 
disorders (except IBD), implicate shared biological pathways with putative 
causality for certain T2D - GI pairs, and identify targets for further 
investigation.

Exposure to heavy metals in various populations can lead to extensive damage to 
different organs, as these metals infiltrate and bioaccumulate in the human 
body, causing metabolic disruptions in various organs. To comprehensively 
understand the metal homeostasis, inter-organ "traffic," and extensive metabolic 
alterations resulting from heavy metal exposure, employing complementary 
analytical methods is crucial. Metabolomics is pivotal in unraveling the 
intricacies of disease vulnerability by furnishing thorough understandings of 
metabolic changes linked to different metabolic diseases. This field offers 
exciting prospects for enhancing the disease prevention, early detection, and 
tailoring treatment approaches to individual needs. This article consolidates 
the existing knowledge on disease-linked metabolic pathways affected by the 
exposure of diverse heavy metals providing concise overview of the underlying 
impact mechanisms. The main aim is to investigate the connection between the 
altered metabolic pathways and long-term complex health conditions induced by 
heavy metals such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, renal 
disorders, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive risks, and 
organ damage. Further exploration of common pathways may unveil the shared 
targets for treating associated pathological conditions. In this article, the 
role of metabolomics in disease susceptibility is emphasized that metabolomics 
is expected to be routinely utilized for the diagnosis and monitoring of 
diseases and practical value of biomarkers derived from metabolomics, as well as 
determining their appropriate integration into extensive clinical settings.

Acute generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a serious illness. Despite various 
treatment methods, there is still lack of effective treatment plans for 
refractory cases with multiple comorbidities. This case report presents a 
67-year-old woman with acute GPP, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, in whom skin symptom disappearance and 
kidney function improvement were observed after the use of oral tacrolimus as 
the sole therapy. This is the first report on the application of tacrolimus in 
the treatment of acute GPP, especially refractory acute GPP. The successful 
treatment indicates that there are shared immune pathways between acute GPP and 
CKD, and the pathways can be interdicted by tacrolimus. Further studies are 
needed to optimize the therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and peripheral 
arterial disease (PAD) are common complications of diabetes mellitus, while 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease contribute to the 
pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers, and the pathogenic mechanisms between 
these three diseases still need further investigation. The keywords 'diabetic 
foot ulcer', 'diabetic peripheral neuropathy' and 'atherosclerosis' were used to 
search for related gene sets in the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were screened and analysed for GO, KEGG and enrichR functional 
enrichment. Potential three disease biomarkers were identified by SVM-SVM-RFE 
and LASSO regression analysis. The results were also validated using external 
datasets and discriminability was measured by area under the ROC curve (AUC). 
Finally, biomarkers and co-upregulated genes were analysed through the GSEA and 
Attie Laboratories diabetes databases. A total of 11 shared genes (KRT16, CD24, 
SAMD9L, SRGAP2, FGL2, GPR34, DDIT4, NFE2L3, FBLN5, ANXA3 and CPA3), two 
biomarkers (SAMD9L and FGL2) and one co-upregulated gene (CD24) were screened. 
GO and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs, enrichr enrichment analysis of shared 
differential genes and GSEA analysis of biomarkers showed that these significant 
genes were mainly focused on vasoregulatory, inflammatory-oxidative stress and 
immunomodulatory pathways. In this study, we used bioinformatics to investigate 
the intrinsic relationship and potential mechanisms of three common lower 
extremity complications of diabetes and identified two pivotal genes using the 
LASSO model and the SVM-RFE algorithm, which will further help clinicians to 
understand the relationship between diabetic complications, improve the 
diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot problems and help doctors to identify 
the potential risk factors of diabetic foot.

BACKGROUND: Chuang-Ling-Ye (CLY) has been clinically proven to be an effective 
Chinese medicine for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of CLY in 
relation to DFU using network pharmacology and molecular docking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, relevant targets of CLY against DFU were 
obtained from TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction database and GEO database. Then, 
topological analysis was employed by Cytoscape to screen the top 6 core active 
ingredients and the top 8 hub targets. Furthermore, the OmicShare Tools were 
applied for gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment analysis. 
Finally, the results of network pharmacology were verified by molecular docking 
method.
RESULTS: CLY has 61 active compounds and 361 targets after de-duplication, and 
the top 8 hub targets were EGFR, TP53, CCND1, IL-1B, CREBBP, AR, PTGS2 and PGR. 
GO enrichment analysis is mainly related to signal transducer activity, receptor 
activity, and molecular transducer activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated 
that these shared targets were primarily focused on AGE-RAGE signaling pathway 
in diabetic complications, HIF-1 signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and 
JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that 
physciondiglucoside, 2-cinnamoyl-glucose and kinobeon A were well bound with 
EGFR, IL-1B, AR and PTGS2.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CLY has anti-oxidative stress and 
anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of DFU through various constituents, 
multiple targets, and multiple pathways, which provides a valuable point of 
reference for future investigations on CLY.

This manuscript explores the role of pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell 
death, in the pathogenesis of two chronic dermatoses, psoriasis and hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS). The diseases, though clinically diverse, share common 
pathogenetic pathways involving the unbalanced interaction between the adaptive 
and innate immune systems. This review focuses on the molecular changes in 
psoriatic and HS skin, emphasizing the activation of dendritic cells, secretion 
of interleukins (IL-17, IL-22, and TNF-α), and the involvement of inflammasomes, 
particularly NLRP3. This manuscript discusses the role of caspases, especially 
caspase-1, in driving pyroptosis and highlights the family of gasdermins (GSDMs) 
as key players in the formation of pores leading to cell rupture and the release 
of proinflammatory signals. This study delves into the potential therapeutic 
implications of targeting pyroptosis in psoriasis and HS, examining existing 
medications like biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors. It also reviews the 
current limitations and challenges in developing therapies that selectively 
target pyroptosis. Additionally, the manuscript explores the role of pyroptosis 
in various inflammatory disorders associated with psoriasis and HS, such as 
inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disorders. The 
review concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to fully elucidate 
the pathomechanisms of these dermatoses and develop effective, targeted 
therapies.

AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD) often coexist and 
share genetic factors.This study aimed to investigate the common genetic factors 
underlying T2D and CAD in patients with CAD.
METHODS: A three-step association approach was conducted: a) a discovery step 
involving 943 CAD patients with T2D and 1,149 CAD patients without T2D; b) an 
eliminating step to exclude CAD or T2D specific variants; and c) a replication 
step using the UK Biobank data.
RESULTS: Ten genetic loci were associated with T2D in CAD patients. Three 
variants were specific to either CAD or T2D. Five variants lost significance 
after adjusting for covariates, while two SNPs remained associated with T2D in 
CAD patients (rs7904519*G: TCF7L2 and rs17608766*C: GOSR2). The T2D 
susceptibility rs7904519*G was associated with increased T2D risk, while the CAD 
susceptibility rs17608766*C was negatively associated with T2D in CAD patients. 
These associations were replicated in a UK Biobank data, confirming the results.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant common T2D and CAD susceptibility genetic 
association was demonstrated indicating distinct disease pathways. However, CAD 
patients carrying the T2D susceptibility gene TCF7L2 remain at higher risk for 
developing T2D emphasizing the need for frequent monitoring in this subgroup.

Metformin (Met) is the first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus but, in 
last few years, it has also been evaluated as anti-cancer agent. Several 
pathways, such as AMPK or PI3K/Akt/mTOR, are likely to be involved in the 
anti-cancer Met activity. In addition, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and H2S donors 
have been described as anti-cancer agents affecting cell-cycle and inducing 
apoptosis. Among H2S donors, isothiocyanates are endowed with a further 
anti-cancer mechanism: the inhibition of the histone deacetylase enzymes. On 
this basis, a hybrid molecule (Met-ITC) obtained through the addition of an 
isothiocyanate moiety to the Met molecule was designed and its ability to 
release Met has been demonstrated. Met-ITC exhibited more efficacy and potency 
than Met in inhibiting cancer cells (AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, MCF-7) viability and it 
was less effective on non-tumorigenic cells (MCF 10-A). The ability of Met-ITC 
to release H2S has been recorded both in cell-free and in cancer cells assays. 
Finally, its ability to affect the cell cycle and to induce both early and late 
apoptosis has been demonstrated on the most sensitive cell line (MCF-7). These 
results confirmed that Met-ITC is a new hybrid molecule endowed with potential 
anti-cancer properties derived both from Met and H2S.

Background: The ability of transcriptome analysis to identify dysregulated 
pathways and outcome-related genes following myocardial infarction in diabetic 
patients remains unknown. The present study was designed to detect possible 
biomarkers associated with the incidence of post-infarction complications in 
diabetes to assist thedevelopment of novel treatments for this 
condition.Methods: Two gene expression datasets, GSE12639 and GSE6880, were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and then 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between post-infarction 
diabetics and healthy samples from the left ventricular wall of rats. These DEGs 
were then arranged into a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) 
enrichment analyses were performed to explore the functional roles of these 
genes.Results: In total, 30 DEGs (14 upregulated and 16 downregulated) were 
shared between these two datasets, as identified through Venn diagram analyses. 
GO analyses revealed these DEGs to be significantly enriched in ovarian 
steroidogenesis, fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, 
synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and butanoate metabolism. The PPI 
network of the DEGs had 14 genes and 70 edges. We identified two key proteins, 
3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) and Δ3, Δ2-Enoyl-CoA Delta 
Isomerase 1 (ECI1), and the upregulated gene Hmgcs2 with the highest score in 
the MCC method. We generated a co-expression network for the hub genes and 
obtained the top ten medications suggested for infarction with 
diabetes.Conclusion: Taken together, the findings of these bioinformatics 
analyses identified key hub genes associated with the development of myocardial 
infarction in diabetics. These hub genes and potential drugs may become novel 
biomarkers for prognosis and precision treatment in the future.
