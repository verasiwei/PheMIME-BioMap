BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shares genetic variants with other 
autoimmune conditions, but existing studies test the association between RA 
variants with a pre-defined set of phenotypes. The objective of this study was 
to perform a large-scale, systemic screen to determine phenotypes that share 
genetic architecture with RA to inform our understanding of shared pathways.
METHODS: In the UK Biobank (UKB), we constructed RA genetic risk scores (GRS) 
incorporating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA risk alleles. Phenotypes 
were defined using groupings of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
codes. Patients with an RA code were excluded to mitigate the possibility of 
associations being driven by the diagnosis or management of RA. We performed a 
phenome-wide association study, testing the association between the RA GRS with 
phenotypes using multivariate generalized estimating equations that adjusted for 
age, sex, and first five principal components. Statistical significance was 
defined using Bonferroni correction. Results were replicated in an independent 
cohort and replicated phenotypes were validated using medical record review of 
patients.
FINDINGS: We studied n = 316,166 subjects from UKB without evidence of RA and 
screened for association between the RA GRS and n = 1317 phenotypes. In the UKB, 
20 phenotypes were significantly associated with the RA GRS, of which 13 (65%) 
were immune mediated conditions including polymyalgia rheumatica, granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (GPA), type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. We further 
identified a novel association in Celiac disease where the HLA and non-HLA 
alleles had strong associations in opposite directions. Strikingly, we observed 
that the non-HLA GRS was exclusively associated with greater risk of the 
validated conditions, suggesting shared underlying pathways outside the HLA 
region.
INTERPRETATION: This study replicated and identified novel autoimmune phenotypes 
verified by medical record review that share immune pathways with RA and may 
inform opportunities for shared treatment targets, as well as risk assessment 
for conditions with a paucity of genomic data, such as GPA.
FUNDING: This research was funded by the US National Institutes of Health 
(P30AR072577, R21AR078339, R35GM142879, T32AR007530) and the Harold and DuVal

The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing annually, in addition to 
other childhood-onset autoimmune diseases. This review is inspired by recent 
strides in research defining the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in celiac 
disease, a disease that has significant genetic overlap with T1D. Population 
genetic studies have demonstrated an increased proportion of newly diagnosed 
young children with T1D also have a higher genetic risk of celiac disease, 
suggesting that shared environmental risk factors are driving the incidence of 
both diseases. The small intestine barrier forms a tightly regulated interface 
of the immune system with the outside world and largely controls the mucosal 
immune response to non-self-antigens, dictating the balance between tolerance 
and immune response. Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of the 
intercellular tight junctions, important in antigen trafficking, and therefore, 
is a key player in regulation of the mucosal immune response. While usually 
tightly controlled, when the zonulin pathway is dysregulated by changes in 
microbiome composition and function, antigen trafficking control is lost, 
leading to loss of mucosal tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. The 
tenant of this hypothesis is that loss of tolerance would not occur if the 
zonulin-dependent intestinal barrier function is restored, thereby preventing 
the influence of environmental triggers in individuals genetically susceptible 
to autoimmunity. This review outlines the current research and a structured 
hypothesis on how a dysregulated small intestinal epithelial barrier, a "leaky 
gut," may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in certain 
individuals at risk of both T1D and celiac disease.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, research has consistently proven the occurrence of 
genetic overlap across autoimmune diseases, which supports the existence of 
common pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity. The objective of this study was to 
further investigate this shared genetic component.
METHODS: For this purpose, we performed a cross-disease meta-analysis of 
Immunochip data from 37,159 patients diagnosed with a seropositive autoimmune 
disease (11,489 celiac disease (CeD), 15,523 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 3477 
systemic sclerosis (SSc), and 6670 type 1 diabetes (T1D)) and 22,308 healthy 
controls of European origin using the R package ASSET.
RESULTS: We identified 38 risk variants shared by at least two of the conditions 
analyzed, five of which represent new pleiotropic loci in autoimmunity. We also 
identified six novel genome-wide associations for the diseases studied. 
Cell-specific functional annotations and biological pathway enrichment analyses 
suggested that pleiotropic variants may act by deregulating gene expression in 
different subsets of T cells, especially Th17 and regulatory T cells. Finally, 
drug repositioning analysis evidenced several drugs that could represent 
promising candidates for CeD, RA, SSc, and T1D treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have been able to advance in the knowledge of the 
genetic overlap existing in autoimmunity, thus shedding light on common 
molecular mechanisms of disease and suggesting novel drug targets that could be 
explored for the treatment of the autoimmune diseases studied.

IMPORTANCE: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway analyses 
supported long-standing observations of an association between immune-mediated 
diseases and Parkinson disease (PD). The post-GWAS era provides an opportunity 
for cross-phenotype analyses between different complex phenotypes.
OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that there are common genetic risk variants 
conveying risk of both PD and autoimmune diseases (ie, pleiotropy) and to 
identify new shared genetic variants and their pathways by applying a novel 
statistical framework in a genome-wide approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the conjunction false discovery rate 
method, this study analyzed GWAS data from a selection of archetypal autoimmune 
diseases among 138 511 individuals of European ancestry and systemically 
investigated pleiotropy between PD and type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, 
ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, psoriasis, and 
multiple sclerosis. NeuroX data (6927 PD cases and 6108 controls) were used for 
replication. The study investigated the biological correlation between the top 
loci through protein-protein interaction and changes in the gene expression and 
methylation levels. The dates of the analysis were June 10, 2015, to March 4, 
2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a list of novel loci and 
their pathways involved in PD and autoimmune diseases.
RESULTS: Genome-wide conjunctional analysis identified 17 novel loci at false 
discovery rate less than 0.05 with overlap between PD and autoimmune diseases, 
including known PD loci adjacent to GAK, HLA-DRB5, LRRK2, and MAPT for 
rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Replication 
confirmed the involvement of HLA, LRRK2, MAPT, TRIM10, and SETD1A in PD. Among 
the novel genes discovered, WNT3, KANSL1, CRHR1, BOLA2, and GUCY1A3 are within a 
protein-protein interaction network with known PD genes. A subset of novel loci 
was significantly associated with changes in methylation or expression levels of 
adjacent genes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study findings provide novel mechanistic insights 
into PD and autoimmune diseases and identify a common genetic pathway between 
these phenotypes. The results may have implications for future therapeutic 
trials involving anti-inflammatory agents.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a complex disorder characterized by an 
autoimmune response against human pancreatic beta-cells. Patients with T1D can 
also develop a response toward one or more other factors, such as in autoimmune 
thyroiditis (AITD) and celiac disease (CD). In the presence of T1D + AITD, the 
patient is diagnosed with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type III (APSIII); 
patients with APSIII may also present with CD. These diseases have a strong 
genetic component and share many susceptibility genes, suggesting potentially 
overlapping pathogenic pathways. Polymorphisms in the TNF-α(rs1800629), CTLA-4 
(rs231775), and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genes have been previous associated with T1D; 
however, there is no consensus regarding their role in T1D and scarce literature 
focusing on AIDT and/or CD. Thus, we analyzed these genetic variants in 205 
Northeast Brazilian patients with T1D and with/without AITD and/or CD, and in 
308 healthy controls. The PTPN22 gene variants were associated with T1D 
susceptibility and APSIII [odds ratio (OR) = 2.57 and 2.77, respectively]. CTLA4 
rs231775 and TNF-αrs1800629 were not associated with T1D onset in the Brazilian 
population. However, when comparing APSIII individuals in the T1D only group, we 
observed an association of the TNF-αSNP in the allelic (P = 0.0442; OR = 0.44) 
and dominant models (P = 0.0387; OR = 0.40). This study reinforces the 
importance of CTLA-4 and other variants in unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms 
of T1D in different populations and in understanding their relationships with 
the development of other T1D-related autoimmune diseases.

Epidemiological studies suggest a relationship between blood lipids and 
immune-mediated diseases, but the nature of these associations is not well 
understood. We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate shared 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between blood lipids and immune-mediated 
diseases. We analyzed data from GWAS (n~200,000 individuals), applying new False 
Discovery Rate (FDR) methods, to investigate genetic overlap between blood lipid 
levels [triglycerides (TG), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density 
lipoproteins (HDL)] and a selection of archetypal immune-mediated diseases 
(Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, 
celiac disease, psoriasis and sarcoidosis). We found significant polygenic 
pleiotropy between the blood lipids and all the investigated immune-mediated 
diseases. We discovered several shared risk loci between the immune-mediated 
diseases and TG (n = 88), LDL (n = 87) and HDL (n = 52). Three-way analyses 
differentiated the pattern of pleiotropy among the immune-mediated diseases. The 
new pleiotropic loci increased the number of functional gene network nodes 
representing blood lipid loci by 40%. Pathway analyses implicated several novel 
shared mechanisms for immune pathogenesis and lipid biology, including 
glycosphingolipid synthesis (e.g. FUT2) and intestinal host-microbe interactions 
(e.g. ATG16L1). We demonstrate a shared genetic basis for blood lipids and 
immune-mediated diseases independent of environmental factors. Our findings 
provide novel mechanistic insights into dyslipidemia and immune-mediated 
diseases and may have implications for therapeutic trials involving 
lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory agents.

BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been increasing evidence shown that a 
non-synonymous exchange (Gly307Ser/rs763361) of the CD226 gene on chromosome 
18q22 is linked to several autoimmune diseases (ADs) including type 1 diabetes 
(T1D), celiac disease (CED), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), 
Grave's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), psoriasis, and primary sicca 
syndrome (pSS). Taking into consideration that different autoimmune diseases may 
share some common pathogenic pathways and in order to assess the overall 
relationship between CD226 Gly307Ser (rs763361) polymorphism and multiple 
autoimmune diseases, we performed this meta-analysis.
METHOD: All eligible case-control studies were searched in the US National 
Library of Medicine's PubMed and Embase database. Crude odds ratios (OR) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) were conducted to assess the association.
RESULTS: 7876 cases and 8558 controls from 7 published studies which were 
selected from 149 articles identified by a search of the US National Library of 
Medicine's PubMed and Embase databases for the period up to 25th April 2012. The 
total OR for ADs associated with the T allele was 1.19 (95%CI=1.12-1.27) by 
random effects model. Significantly increased risks were also observed in the 
South American (OR=1.72, 95%CI=1.34-2.20), Asian (OR=1.46, 95%CI=1.01-2.10), and 
European (OR=1.29, 95%CI=1.07-1.58). Similarly, significant associations were 
observed in two genetic models (OR=1.41, 95%CI=1.23-1.62 in a codominant model; 
OR=1.33, 95%CI=1.18-1.50 in a recessive model).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provided evidence that CD226 Gly307Ser (rs763361) 
is significantly associated with the risk of multiple autoimmune diseases.

Both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are common, 
highly heritable conditions, the pathogenesis of which are incompletely 
understood. Gene-mapping studies in both conditions have over the last couple of 
years made major breakthroughs in identifying the mechanisms by which these 
diseases occur. Considering RA, there is an over-representation of genes 
involved in TNF signalling and the NFKappaB pathway that have been shown to 
influence the disease risk. There is also considerable sharing of susceptibility 
genes between RA and other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus 
erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac disease, 
with thus far little overlap with AS. In AS, genes involved in response to 
IL12/IL23, and in endoplasmic reticulum peptide presentation, have been 
identified, but a full genomewide association study has not yet been reported.

Our genome-wide association study of celiac disease previously identified risk 
variants in the IL2-IL21 region. To identify additional risk variants, we 
genotyped 1,020 of the most strongly associated non-HLA markers in an additional 
1,643 cases and 3,406 controls. Through joint analysis including the genome-wide 
association study data (767 cases, 1,422 controls), we identified seven 
previously unknown risk regions (P < 5 x 10(-7)). Six regions harbor genes 
controlling immune responses, including CCR3, IL12A, IL18RAP, RGS1, SH2B3 (nsSNP 
rs3184504) and TAGAP. Whole-blood IL18RAP mRNA expression correlated with 
IL18RAP genotype. Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease share HLA-DQ, IL2-IL21, 
CCR3 and SH2B3 risk regions. Thus, this extensive genome-wide association 
follow-up study has identified additional celiac disease risk variants in 
relevant biological pathways.
