The relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early onset 
atherosclerosis is well depicted, each with an important inflammatory component. 
Glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), a novel biomarker of inflammation, may play a role 
in the manifestation of these two inflammatory conditions. The present study 
examined a potential mediating role of GlycA within the RA-atherosclerosis 
relationship to determine whether it accounts for the excess risk of 
cardiovascular disease over that posed by lipid risk factors. The UK Biobank 
dataset was acquired to establish associations among RA, atherosclerosis, GlycA, 
and major lipid factors: total cholesterol (TC), high- and low-density 
lipoprotein (HDL, LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs). Genome-wide 
association study summary statistics were collected from various resources to 
perform genetic analyses. Causality among variables was tested using Mendelian 
Randomization (MR) analysis. Genes of interest were identified using 
colocalization analysis and gene enrichment analysis. MR results appeared to 
indicate that the genetic relationship between GlycA and RA and also between RA 
and atherosclerosis was explained by horizontal pleiotropy (p-value = 0.001 and 
<0.001, respectively), while GlycA may causally predict atherosclerosis (p-value 
= 0.017). Colocalization analysis revealed several functionally relevant genes 
shared between GlycA and all the variables assessed. Two loci were apparent in 
all relationships tested and included the HLA region as well as SLC22A1. GlycA 
appears to mediate the RA-atherosclerosis relationship through several possible 
pathways. GlycA, although pleiotropically related to RA, appears to causally 
predict atherosclerosis. Thus, GlycA is suggested as a significant factor in the 
etiology of atherosclerosis development in RA.

BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to various chronic diseases has been shown to 
influence heart failure (HF) risk. However, the underlying biological pathways, 
particularly the role of leukocyte telomere length (LTL), are largely unknown. 
We investigated the impact of genetic susceptibility to chronic diseases and 
various traits on HF risk, and whether LTL mediates or modifies the pathways.
METHODS: We conducted prospective cohort analyses on 404 883 European 
participants from the UK Biobank, including 9989 incident HF cases. 
Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate associations between HF risk 
and 24 polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for various diseases or traits previously 
generated using a Bayesian approach. We assessed multiplicative interactions 
between the PRSs and LTL previously measured in the UK Biobank using 
quantitative PCR. Causal mediation analyses were conducted to estimate the 
proportion of the total effect of PRSs acting indirectly through LTL, an 
integrative marker of biological aging.
RESULTS: We identified 9 PRSs associated with HF risk, including those for 
various cardiovascular diseases or traits, rheumatoid arthritis (P = 1.3E-04), 
and asthma (P = 1.8E-08). Additionally, longer LTL was strongly associated with 
decreased HF risk (P-trend = 1.7E-08). Notably, LTL strengthened the asthma-HF 
relationship significantly (P-interaction = 2.8E-03). However, LTL mediated only 
1.13% (P < 0.001) of the total effect of the asthma PRS on HF risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light onto the shared genetic susceptibility 
between HF risk, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other traits. Longer LTL 
strengthened the genetic effect of asthma in the pathway to HF. These results 
support consideration of LTL and PRSs in HF risk prediction.

Despite extensive research reveal rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to 
atherosclerosis (AS), common pathogenesis between these two diseases still needs 
to be explored. In current study, we explored the common pathogenesis between 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atherosclerosis (AS) by identifying 297 
Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) associated with both diseases. Through 
KEGG and GO functional analysis, we highlighted the correlation of these DEGs 
with crucial biological processes such as the vesicle transport, immune system 
process, signaling receptor binding, chemokine signaling and many others. 
Employing Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis, we elucidated the 
associations between DEGs, revealing three gene modules enriched in immune 
system process, vesicle, signaling receptor binding, Pertussis, and among 
others. Additionally, through CytoHubba analysis, we pinpointed 11 hub genes 
integral to intergrin-mediated signaling pathway, plasma membrane, 
phosphotyrosine binding, chemokine signaling pathway and so on. Further 
investigation via the TRRUST database identified two key Transcription Factors 
(TFs), SPI1 and RELA, closely linked with these hub genes, shedding light on 
their regulatory roles. Finally, leveraging the collective insights from hub 
genes and TFs, we proposed 10 potential drug candidates targeting the molecular 
mechanisms underlying RA and AS pathogenesis. Further investigation on xCell 
revealed that 14 types of cells were all different in both AS and RA. This study 
underscores the shared pathogenic mechanisms, pivotal genes, and potential 
therapeutic interventions bridging RA and AS, offering valuable insights for 
future research and clinical management strategies.

The association between chronic inflammation and increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well established. In the 
general population, inflammation is an established independent risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, and much interest is placed on controlling inflammation 
to reduce cardiovascular events. As inflammation encompasses numerous pathways, 
the development of targeted therapies in RA provides an opportunity to 
understand the downstream effect of inhibiting specific pathways on 
cardiovascular risk. Data from these studies can inform cardiovascular risk 
management in patients with RA, and in the general population. This Review 
focuses on pro-inflammatory pathways targeted by existing therapies in RA and 
with mechanistic data from the general population on cardiovascular risk. 
Specifically, the discussions include the IL-1, IL-6 and TNF pathways, as well 
as the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 
(STAT) signalling pathway, and the role of these pathways in RA pathogenesis in 
the joint alongside the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Overall, some robust data support inhibition of IL-1 and IL-6 in decreasing the 
risk of cardiovascular disease, with growing data supporting IL-6 inhibition in 
both patients with RA and the general population to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular disease.

Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases (ICD-10: J30-J39), such 
as diseases of the sinonasal tract, pharynx and larynx, are growing health 
problems yet their genomic similarity is not known. We analyze genome-wide 
association to eight upper respiratory diseases (61,195 cases) among 260,405 
FinnGen participants, meta-analyzing diseases in four groups based on an 
underlying genetic correlation structure. Aiming to understand which genetic 
loci contribute to susceptibility to upper respiratory diseases in general and 
its subtypes, we detect 41 independent genome-wide significant loci, 
distinguishing impact on sinonasal or pharyngeal diseases, or both. Fine-mapping 
implicated non-synonymous variants in nine genes, including three linked to 
immune-related diseases. Phenome-wide analysis implicated asthma and atopic 
dermatitis at sinonasal disease loci, and inflammatory bowel diseases and other 
immune-mediated disorders at pharyngeal disease loci. Upper respiratory diseases 
also genetically correlated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and psoriasis. Finally, we associated 
separate gene pathways in sinonasal and pharyngeal diseases that both contribute 
to type 2 immunological reaction. We show shared heritability among upper 
respiratory diseases that extends to several immune-mediated diseases with 
diverse mechanisms, such as type 2 high inflammation.

We performed a database mining on 102 transcriptomic datasets for the 
expressions of 29 m6A-RNA methylation (epitranscriptomic) regulators (m6A-RMRs) 
in 41 diseases and cancers and made significant findings: (1) a few m6A-RMRs 
were upregulated; and most m6A-RMRs were downregulated in sepsis, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and trauma; (2) half of 29 m6A-RMRs were 
downregulated in atherosclerosis; (3) inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid 
arthritis modulated m6A-RMRs more than lupus and psoriasis; (4) some organ 
failures shared eight upregulated m6A-RMRs; end-stage renal failure (ESRF) 
downregulated 85% of m6A-RMRs; (5) Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
infections modulated m6A-RMRs the most among viral infections; (6) 
proinflammatory oxPAPC modulated m6A-RMRs more than DAMP stimulation including 
LPS and oxLDL; (7) upregulated m6A-RMRs were more than downregulated m6A-RMRs in 
cancer types; five types of cancers upregulated ≥10 m6A-RMRs; (8) 
proinflammatory M1 macrophages upregulated seven m6A-RMRs; (9) 86% of m6A-RMRs 
were differentially expressed in the six clusters of CD4+Foxp3+ 
immunosuppressive Treg, and 8 out of 12 Treg signatures regulated m6A-RMRs; (10) 
immune checkpoint receptors TIM3, TIGIT, PD-L2, and CTLA4 modulated m6A-RMRs, 
and inhibition of CD40 upregulated m6A-RMRs; (11) cytokines and interferons 
modulated m6A-RMRs; (12) NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways upregulated more than 
downregulated m6A-RMRs whereas TP53, PTEN, and APC did the opposite; (13) 
methionine-homocysteine-methyl cycle enzyme Mthfd1 downregulated more than 
upregulated m6A-RMRs; (14) m6A writer RBM15 and one m6A eraser FTO, H3K4 
methyltransferase MLL1, and DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, regulated m6A-RMRs; 
and (15) 40 out of 165 ROS regulators were modulated by m6A eraser FTO and two 
m6A writers METTL3 and WTAP. Our findings shed new light on the functions of 
upregulated m6A-RMRs in 41 diseases and cancers, nine cellular and molecular 
mechanisms, novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory disorders, metabolic 
cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, organ failures, and cancers.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) carries significant risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Traditional ASCVD risk factors fail to account 
for this accelerated atherosclerosis. Shared inflammatory pathways are 
fundamental in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Considering the impact of RA 
in increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the characterization of 
therapies encompassing both RA and ASCVD management merit high priority. Despite 
little progress, several drugs discussed here promote remission and or lower 
rheumatoid disease activity while simultaneously conferring some level of 
atheroprotection. Methotrexate, a widely used disease-modifying drug used in RA, 
is associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular adverse events. MTX 
promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophages, upregulates free radical 
scavenging and improves endothelial function. Likewise, the sulfonamide drug 
sulfasalazine positively impacts the lipid profile by increasing HDL-C, and its 
use in RA has been correlated with reduced risk of myocardial infraction. In the 
biologic class, inhibitors of TNF-α and IL-6 contribute to improvements in 
endothelial function and promote anti-atherogenic properties of HDL-C, 
respectively. The immunosuppressant hydroxychloroquine positively affects 
insulin sensitization and the lipid profile. While no individual therapy has 
elicited optimal atheroprotection, further investigation of combination 
therapies are ongoing.

methylation using blood samples from 3,799 Europeans and 3,195 South Asians. We 
identify 11,165,559 SNP-CpG associations (methylation quantitative trait loci 
(meQTL), P < 10-14), including 467,915 meQTL that operate in trans. The meQTL 
are enriched for functionally relevant characteristics, including shared 
chromatin state, High-throuhgput chromosome conformation interaction, and 
association with gene expression, metabolic variation and clinical traits. We 
use molecular interaction and colocalization analyses to identify multiple 
nuclear regulatory pathways linking meQTL loci to phenotypic variation, 
including UBASH3B (body mass index), NFKBIE (rheumatoid arthritis), MGA (blood 
pressure) and COMMD7 (white cell counts). For rs6511961 , chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) validates zinc finger 
protein (ZNF)333 as the likely trans acting effector protein. Finally, we used 
interaction analyses to identify population- and lineage-specific meQTL, 
including rs174548 in FADS1, with the strongest effect in CD8+ T cells, thus 
linking fatty acid metabolism with immune dysregulation and asthma. Our study 
advances understanding of the potential pathways linking genetic variation to 
human phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have high risk of heart failure 
(HF).
AIMS: Identifying the risk factors and mechanistic pathways associated with HF 
in patients with RA.
METHODS: Cohort study enrolling 355 RA patients. HF was defined according to the 
ESC criteria. 93 circulating protein-biomarkers 
(91CVDIIOlink®+troponin-T+c-reactive protein) were measured. Regression modeling 
(multivariate and multivariable) were built and network analyses were performed 
- based on the identified relevant protein biomarkers.
RESULTS: 115 (32.4%) patients fulfilled the ESC criteria for HF, but only 24 
(6.8%) had a prior HF diagnosis. Patients with HF were older (67 vs. 55yr), had 
a longer RA duration (10 vs. 14yr), had more frequently diabetes, hypertension, 
obesity, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic arterial disease. 
Several protein-biomarkers remained independently associated with HF, the top 
(FDR1%) were adrenomedullin, placenta-growth-factor, TNF-receptor-11A, and 
angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2. The networks underlying the expression of these 
biomarkers pointed towards congestion, apoptosis, inflammation, immune system 
signaling and RAAS activation as central determinants of HF in RA. Similar 
HF-associated biomarker-pathways were externally found in patients without RA. 
Having RA plus HF increased the risk of cardiovascular events compared to RA 
patients without RF; adjusted-HR (95%CI)=2.37 (1.07-5.30), p=0.034 CONCLUSION: 
Age, cardiovascular risk factors, and RA duration increase the HF odds in 
patients with RA. Few RA patients had a correct prior HF diagnosis, but the 
presence of HF increased the patients` risk. RA patients with HF largely share 
the mechanistic pathways of HF patients without RA. Randomized HF trials should 
include patients with RA. CLINICALTRIALS.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder influenced by 
both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenome-wide association studies can 
identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA 
methylation, which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate 
possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid 
arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity, we investigated 
genome-wide DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs.
METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 79 monozygotic twin pairs 
discordant for rheumatoid arthritis using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array 
(Illumina). Discordant twins were tested for both differential DNA methylation 
and methylation variability between rheumatoid arthritis and healthy twins. The 
methylation variability signature was then compared with methylation variants 
from studies of other autoimmune diseases and with an independent healthy 
population.
RESULTS: We have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature 
that suggests multiple stress response pathways may be involved in the aetiology 
of the disease. This methylation variability signature also highlighted 
potential epigenetic disruption of multiple RUNX3 transcription factor binding 
sites as being associated with disease development. Comparison with previously 
performed epigenome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 
diabetes identified shared pathways for autoimmune disorders, suggesting that 
epigenetics plays a role in autoimmunity and offering the possibility of 
identifying new targets for intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Through genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in 
disease-discordant monozygotic twins, we have identified a differentially 
variable DNA methylation signature, in the absence of differential methylation 
in rheumatoid arthritis. This finding supports the importance of epigenetic 
variability as an emerging component in autoimmune disorders.
