The womb is an influential first home. This felicitous phrase is attributed to 
David Barker, often called the father of the late 20th century developmental 
origins of health and disease hypothesis, which asserts that maternal 
experiences during pregnancy are biologically transmitted to, and embedded in, 
the fetus, shaping child development.1 Specifically, Barker focused on maternal 
inadequate nutrition as a key in utero exposure to which the fetus biologically 
adapts, leading to biologically programmed changes, meaning long-lasting, that 
potentially put the offspring at risk for future metabolic diseases.1 In more 
recent developmental origins of health and disease publications, the impact of 
affective symptoms in pregnant women-defined broadly to include perceived 
stress, depression, and anxiety-on fetal and infant brain and behavior 
development has been identified. There is a third pathway for the familial 
inheritance of risk for psychiatric illness beyond shared genes and compromised 
parental postnatal mental health and caregiving: prenatal programming of risk 
for psychopathology originating in mental health symptoms of mothers.1 However, 
despite decades of experimental preclinical studies demonstrating maternal 
prenatal stress predicting altered offspring outcomes,2 the alternative 
interpretation-that shared genes of risk account for the outcomes-has remained 
challenging to disprove for human studies, perhaps particularly when the mother 
reports on her own and her child's mental health (a common study design further 
addressed below). In this context, the article by Chen et al.3 using polygenic 
risk scores to provide a single measure of genomic risk for complex phenotypes 
reports rigorous and original results demonstrating effects of maternal 
affective symptoms on child psychiatric outcomes while controlling for genomic 
risk.

Traditional approaches to understanding metabolomics in mental illness have 
focused on investigating a single disorder or comparisons between diagnoses, but 
a growing body of evidence suggests substantial mechanistic overlap in mental 
disorders that could be reflected by the metabolome. In this study, we 
investigated associations between global plasma metabolites and abnormal scores 
on the depression, anxiety, and phobic anxiety subscales of the Brief Symptom 
Inventory (BSI) among 405 older males who participated in the Normative Aging 
Study (NAS). Our analysis revealed overlapping and distinct metabolites 
associated with each mental health dimension subscale and four metabolites 
belonging to xenobiotic, carbohydrate, and amino acid classes that were 
consistently associated across all three symptom dimension subscales. 
Furthermore, three of these four metabolites demonstrated a higher degree of 
alteration in men who reported poor scores in all three dimensions compared to 
men with poor scores in only one, suggesting the potential for shared underlying 
biology but a differing degree of perturbation when depression and anxiety 
symptoms co-occur. Our findings implicate pathways of interest relevant to the 
overlap of mental health conditions in aging veterans and could represent 
clinically translatable targets underlying poor mental health in this high-risk 
population.

Past-oriented rumination and future-oriented worry are two aspects of 
perseverative negative thinking related to the neuroticism endophenotype and 
associated with depression and anxiety. Our present aim was to investigate the 
genomic background of these two aspects of perseverative negative thinking 
within separate groups of individuals with suboptimal versus optimal folate 
intake. We conducted a genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank database 
(n = 72,621) on the "rumination" and "worry" items of the Eysenck Personality 
Inventory Neuroticism scale in these separate groups. Optimal folate intake was 
related to lower worry, but unrelated to rumination. In contrast, genetic 
associations for worry did not implicate specific biological processes, while 
past-oriented rumination had a more specific genetic background, emphasizing its 
endophenotypic nature. Furthermore, biological pathways leading to rumination 
appeared to differ according to folate intake: purinergic signaling and 
circadian regulator gene ARNTL emerged in the whole sample, blastocyst 
development, DNA replication, and C-C chemokines in the suboptimal folate group, 
and prostaglandin response and K+ channel subunit gene KCNH3 in the optimal 
folate group. Our results point to possible benefits of folate in anxiety 
disorders, and to the importance of simultaneously taking into account genetic 
and environmental factors to determine personalized intervention in polygenic 
and multifactorial disorders.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders in comorbidity with chronic skin diseases may 
worsen disease outcome and patients' quality of life. We hypothesized the 
comorbidity of depression, anxiety syndromes, or symptoms as attributable to 
biological mechanisms that the combined diseases share.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement searching into PubMed, 
PsycInfo, and Scopus databases. We examined the literature regarding the 
comorbidity of psoriasis (Ps), atopic dermatitis (AD), or hidradenitis 
suppurativa with depression and/or anxiety in adults ≥18 years and the 
hypothetical shared underlying biological mechanisms.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were analyzed, mostly regarding Ps and AD. 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling and 
nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways arose as shared mechanisms in Ps 
animal models with depression- and/or anxiety-like behaviors. Activated 
microglia and neuroinflammatory responses emerged in AD depressive models. As to 
genetic studies, atopic-dermatitis patients with comorbid anxiety traits carried 
the short variant of serotonin transporter and a polymorphism of the human 
translocator protein gene. A GA genotype of catechol-O-methyltransferase gene 
was instead associated with Ps. Reduced natural killer cell activity, IL-4, 
serotonin serum levels, and increased plasma cortisol and IgE levels were 
hypothesized in comorbid depressive AD patients. In Ps patients with comorbid 
depression, high serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-18, as well as IL-17A, were 
presumed to act as shared inflammatory mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies should investigate mental disorders and chronic 
skin diseases concurrently across patients' life course and identify their 
temporal relation and biological correlates. Future research should also 
identify biological characteristics of individuals at high risk of the comorbid 
disorders and associated complications.

BACKGROUND: A major research finding in the field of Biological Psychiatry is 
that symptom-based categories of mental disorders map poorly onto dysfunctions 
in brain circuits or neurobiological pathways. Many of the identified (neuro) 
biological dysfunctions are "transdiagnostic", meaning that they do not reflect 
diagnostic boundaries but are shared by different ICD/DSM diagnoses. The 
compromised biological validity of the current classification system for mental 
disorders impedes rather than supports the development of treatments that not 
only target symptoms but also the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The 
Biological Classification of Mental Disorders (BeCOME) study aims to identify 
biology-based classes of mental disorders that improve the translation of novel 
biomedical findings into tailored clinical applications.
METHODS: BeCOME intends to include at least 1000 individuals with a broad 
spectrum of affective, anxiety and stress-related mental disorders as well as 
500 individuals unaffected by mental disorders. After a screening visit, all 
participants undergo in-depth phenotyping procedures and omics assessments on 
two consecutive days. Several validated paradigms (e.g., fear conditioning, 
reward anticipation, imaging stress test, social reward learning task) are 
applied to stimulate a response in a basic system of human functioning (e.g., 
acute threat response, reward processing, stress response or social reward 
learning) that plays a key role in the development of affective, anxiety and 
stress-related mental disorders. The response to this stimulation is then read 
out across multiple levels. Assessments comprise genetic, molecular, cellular, 
physiological, neuroimaging, neurocognitive, psychophysiological and 
psychometric measurements. The multilevel information collected in BeCOME will 
be used to identify data-driven biologically-informed categories of mental 
disorders using cluster analytical techniques.
DISCUSSION: The novelty of BeCOME lies in the dynamic in-depth phenotyping and 
omics characterization of individuals with mental disorders from the depression 
and anxiety spectrum of varying severity. We believe that such biology-based 
subclasses of mental disorders will serve as better treatment targets than 
purely symptom-based disease entities, and help in tailoring the right treatment 
to the individual patient suffering from a mental disorder. BeCOME has the 
potential to contribute to a novel taxonomy of mental disorders that integrates 
the underlying pathomechanisms into diagnoses.

Patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) frequently manifest comorbid 
neuropsychiatric symptoms with depression and anxiety being most frequent, and 
individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased prevalence of 
LOAD. This suggests shared etiologies and intersecting pathways between LOAD and 
MDD. We performed pleiotropy analyses using LOAD and MDD GWAS data sets from the 
International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and the Psychiatric 
Genomics Consortium (PGC), respectively. We found a moderate enrichment for SNPs 
associated with LOAD across increasingly stringent levels of significance with 
the MDD GWAS association (LOAD|MDD), of maximum four and eightfolds, including 
and excluding the APOE-region, respectively. Association analysis excluding the 
APOE-region identified numerous SNPs corresponding to 40 genes, 9 of which are 
known LOAD-risk loci primarily in chromosome 11 regions that contain the SPI1 
gene and MS4A genes cluster, and others were novel pleiotropic risk-loci for 
LOAD conditional with MDD. The most significant associated SNPs on chromosome 11 
overlapped with eQTLs found in whole-blood and monocytes, suggesting functional 
roles in gene regulation. The reverse conditional association analysis 
(MDD|LOAD) showed a moderate level, ~sevenfold, of polygenic overlap, however, 
no SNP showed significant association. Pathway analyses replicated previously 
reported LOAD biological pathways related to immune response and regulation of 
endocytosis. In conclusion, we provide insights into the overlapping genetic 
signatures underpinning the common phenotypic manifestations and 
inter-relationship between LOAD and MDD. This knowledge is crucial to the 
development of actionable targets for novel therapies to treat depression 
preceding dementia, in an effort to delay or ultimately prevent the onset of 
LOAD.

The present study was undertaken to explore the interactions between sleep 
deprivation (SD) and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (SCF) treatment in the 
antidepressant-like effects. We observed that SD aggravated the anxiety-like 
behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in the elevated 
plus maze test. However, the forced swimming test and sucrose preference test 
showed that SD (12 hr) alleviated the depressive symptoms and SD (72 hr) has the 
opposite effects. Administration of SCF showed a promising therapeutic effect on 
depression and anxiety induced by CUMS and SD. Moreover, SCF could potential 
strengthen the antidepressant-like effects of SD (12 hr) according to the 
behavioral tests. In addition, the BDNF level in hippocampus was elevated by SD 
(12 hr) and SCF treatment and together with the upregulation of TrkB/CREB/ERK 
and PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/mTOR signaling pathways. Besides, the protein levels of 
p70S6K and PSD95, which are downstream targets of mTOR, also increased by the 
treatment. These results indicated that the antidepressant-like effect of SCF in 
the CUMS depends on the activation of BDNF and the modulation of TrkB/CREB/ERK 
and PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/mTOR signaling cascades, and SD (12 hr) shared a common 
etiology consisting of complex bidirectional interactions with SCF.

Stress and low serotonin levels are important biological factors in depression 
and anxiety etiologies. Although studies indicate that low serotonin levels, 
stress, and other factors may interact in depression/anxiety psychopathology, 
few studies have investigated the potentially shared neural substrates. We 
conducted resting-state fMRI scans pre- and post-stress task, and under control 
and tryptophan depletion condition, to explore the common changes induced by 
acute mental stress (AMS) and acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). The present 
study targeted regions within core brain networks - default mode network, 
salience network, executive control network, and emotion network - reported 
altered in AMS and ATD, and used regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional 
connectivity (FC) analyses to explore their overlapped effects. We additionally 
examined the relationships among core neural networks - operationalized as an 
index of resource allocation bias that quantifies the shift from internal to 
external modes of processing. We found both manipulations induced increased ReHo 
of the amygdala and decreased ReHo of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The 
PCC-amygdala FC was negatively correlated with the change of negative affect, 
whereas the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula FC 
was positively associated with anxiety level. In addition, we found that a 
greater shift to an external mode was correlated with higher anxiety level under 
both conditions. Common changes induced by acute mental stress and acute 
tryptophan depletion confirmed our hypothesis that AMS and ATD induce changes in 
common neural pathways, which in turn might mark vulnerability to depression and 
anxiety.

The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis applied to 
neurodevelopmental outcomes asserts that the fetal origins of future development 
are relevant to mental health. There is a third pathway for the familial 
inheritance of risk for psychiatric illness beyond shared genes and the quality 
of parental care: the impact of pregnant women's distress-defined broadly to 
include perceived stress, life events, depression, and anxiety-on fetal and 
infant brain-behavior development. We discuss epidemiological and observational 
clinical data demonstrating that maternal distress is associated with children's 
increased risk for psychopathology: For example, high maternal anxiety is 
associated with a twofold increase in the risk of probable mental disorder in 
children. We review several biological systems hypothesized to be mechanisms by 
which maternal distress affects fetal and child brain and behavior development, 
as well as the clinical implications of studies of the developmental origins of 
health and disease that focus on maternal distress. Development and parenting 
begin before birth.

Perinatal depression is a significant public health problem, due to its negative 
impact on maternal well-being and long-term adverse effects for children. 
Mother-infant interaction and maternal responsiveness and sensitivity are a 
hypothesized mechanism by which perinatal depression effects child development, 
and increasing research in the microbiota-gut-brain axis may provide a new 
avenue of investigation. There is limited efficacy for treatment of perinatal 
depression for improving the mother-infant relationship and child outcomes. The 
maternal microbiota may be the basis of child outcomes through foetal 
programming and sharing of microbes between mother and infant. There is evidence 
that less diversity of the intestinal microbial community is associated with 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety in mothers and 
offspring. Assessing the maternal and child's microbial communities may be an 
important missing component in mother-infant attachment-based therapies during 
treatment of perinatal depression. Probiotics and prebiotics require further 
research as additions to mother-infant interventions. Further research may 
enable identification of bacterial genes that indicate specific pathways that 
could be targeted to improve outcomes for mother and child.
